This section includes services offered, tools provided, and programs run by the UCSB Library that directly enable open science practices. Some offerings are hosted and operated by the Library, while others are subscription-based or externally developed platforms made available to the campus community. Excluded from this section are tools supported solely through instruction or consultation (e.g., open-source programming languages).

### Carpentries program
UCSB Library is a member of The Carpentries, an international organization that teaches foundational coding and data science skills to researchers. The [UCSB Carpentries Program](https://carpentry.library.ucsb.edu/) offers hands-on workshops, supports instructor training and certification, and fosters a local learning community.

### Coder workspaces
[Coder Workspaces](https://coder.dreamlab.ucsb.edu) are on-demand virtual computing environments preconfigured with commonly used data science and programming tools. They allow users to access a consistent software setup without installing tools locally. These workspaces are supported through the [DREAM Lab’s virtual machine services](https://www.library.ucsb.edu/dreamlab/virtual-machines-and-remote-software-access).

### Data rescue
The Research Data Services team can help safeguard at-risk datasets. This includes determining whether a dataset has already been preserved elsewhere and assisting with the rescue and preservation of endangered data not yet preserved. Contact Research Data Services for more information.

### DMPTool
[DMPTool](https://dmptool.org/) is an online platform that helps researchers create, review, and share data management plans required by many funding agencies. It provides guided templates aligned with specific funder requirements and institutional best practices. UCSB Library supports campus access and use of this tool.

### Dryad
[Dryad](https://datadryad.org/) is the institutional data repository for the University of California. Endorsed by funders and academic publishers, it supports the sharing and preservation of research data underlying scholarly publications. UCSB Library supports researchers depositing their data into Dryad.

### eScholarship
[eScholarship](https://escholarship.org/) is the institutional repository and open-access publishing platform of the University of California. It supports the dissemination of scholarly articles, books, theses, and other research outputs produced by the UC community. UCSB Library supports campus participation and use of the platform.

### EZID
EZID is a service provided by the California Digital Library that creates and manages persistent identifiers, such as DOIs and ARKs, for research outputs. These identifiers help ensure that data and other digital objects can be reliably cited and accessed over time. UCSB Library manages the campus account.

### LibGuides, OS-themed
The library has developed LibGuides related to Open Science for self-directed learning. They provide introductory information, resources, and recommended practices on topics such as [ORCiD]( https://guides.library.ucsb.edu/ORCID), [Copyright](https://guides.library.ucsb.edu/copyrights), [Research Data Management](https://guides.library.ucsb.edu/data_management), etc.

### Open access fund
The Open Access Publishing Fund supports UCSB authors who want to make their research available to readers immediately upon publication. It’s paused for 2025-2026. Consult the Library [Scholarly Communication webpage](https://www.library.ucsb.edu/ucsb-open-access-publishing-fund) for the latest updates.

### ORCiD
[ORCID](https://orcid.org/) provides a persistent digital identifier that distinguishes researchers and connects them to their scholarly outputs. UCSB Library supports campus adoption of ORCID to improve author identification and attribution.

### OSPO network office
The [UC Open Source Program Office (OSPO) Network](https://ucospo.net/) aims to harness the collective power of UC campuses to revolutionize open-source practices in academia. Its goal is to “foster innovation, promote knowledge sharing, and establish best practices for open-source software development and usage.”

### Protocols.io
[protocols.io](protocols.io) is an online platform for documenting and sharing research protocols. It enables researchers to create detailed, versioned, and citable methods that can be shared publicly or within private groups. UCSB Library supports campus access to the platform. See this [Getting Started with Protocols.io at UCSB](dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.dm6gpm888gzp/v2) guide.

### Reproducible and Collaborative Lab (RCL)
The [Reproducible and Collaborative Lab](https://ucsb-library-research-data-services.github.io/reproducible-lab/) program combines workshops, self-paced learning, and personalized coaching sessions for UCSB faculty and their teams. It aims to meet researchers where they are by providing tailored consultation on data management, collaborative coding, developing scripted analytical workflows, and preserving scientific products.

### Transformative Agreements
The University of California negotiates [Open Access Publishing Agreements and Discounts](https://osc.universityofcalifornia.edu/for-authors/publishing-discounts/) (also known as Transformative Agreements) to support UC authors publishing open access. Authors can search the [UC Journal Open Access Lookup Tool](https://jolt.cdlib.org/ucsb) (JOLT) to see if UC has agreements with specific journals/publishers and the extent of funding support.
