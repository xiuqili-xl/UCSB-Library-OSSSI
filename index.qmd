## Project description

Between April and December 2025, the UCSB Library conducted an internal review of our current programs, services, training, tools, and resources supporting **open science**. This project aimed to (1) develop a comprehensive inventory of existing offerings and (2) identify strategic opportunities for growth. This webpage provides a high-level overview of our findings.

Our inventory captured 40+ distinct offerings, including

* [Services & Programs](quarto-pages/services.qmd)
* [Instruction & Consultation](quarto-pages/instruction.qmd)
* [Engagement & Community](quarto-pages/engagement.qmd)

As part of the inventory process, **a mapping of relationships** among offerings, providers, and open science topical domains organically emerged. Rather than existing in isolation, these activities form a highly **interconnected network** of support across the library.

Interact with the visual below by hovering over individual elements. Additional details about specific activities can be explored through the other tabs on this site.

## Key Takeaways

* Open science support at UCSB Library spans a wide range of services, instructional activities, and community engagement efforts.
* Many offerings are interconnected through shared contributors, tools, or topical focus areas.
* Viewing these activities as a network, rather than as a list, reveals opportunities for coordination, alignment, and internal awareness.
