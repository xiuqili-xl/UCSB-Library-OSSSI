    "text": "Findings\nOur inventory captured 40+ distinct offerings, including\n\nServices & Programs\nInstruction & Consultation\nEngagement & Community\n\nAs part of the inventory process, a mapping of relationships among offerings, providers, and open science topical domains organically emerged. Rather than existing in isolation, these activities form a highly interconnected network of support across the library.\nInteract with the visual above by hovering over individual elements. Additional details about specific activities can be explored through the other tabs on this site.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nOpen science support at UCSB Library spans a wide range of services, instructional activities, and community engagement efforts.\nMany offerings are interconnected through shared contributors, tools, or topical focus areas.\nViewing these activities as a network, rather than as a list, reveals opportunities for coordination, alignment, and internal awareness."
